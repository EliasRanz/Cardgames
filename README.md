# Cardgames
A java class composed of card games - designed as a tool for me to learn java.

Currently the game is only playable via the command line. Verify version of java you have by running `java -version` in the command line. This should give you back either java 1.8 or java 1.7. These are currently the only available versions of java that is supported by the game.

For java 1.8 users remain on the master branch and go into the following directory in the project -> [out/artifacts/Cargame_jar/Cardgame.jar](https://github.com/Xxplosions/Cardgames/blob/master/out/artifacts/Cardgame_jar/Cardgame.jar)

For java 1.7 users switch to the java7 branch and go to into the following directory in the project -> [out/artifacts/Cargame_jar/Cardgame.jar](https://github.com/Xxplosions/Cardgames/blob/java7/out/artifacts/Cardgame_jar/Cardgame.jar)

Once there you will be able to download the jar file by clicking on the View Raw link. Awesome one step done. Now what you'll want to do is cd into the directory that you just downloaded it to and execute the following command. `java -jar Cardgame.jar`. Alternatively you can replace Cardgame.jar with the full path of where you downloaded the game to.
